Math Solver Chatbot
This is a Python program that creates a chatbot that can solve basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Usage
To use the chatbot, simply run the chatbot() function in the program. The chatbot will prompt the user to input a math problem to solve, and will respond with the answer if the problem is a basic mathematical operation. The user can exit the chatbot by typing "exit".

Functionality
The solve_math_operation() function in the program is responsible for solving basic mathematical operations. It takes a math expression as input and returns the result of the operation. The chatbot() function is the main function for the chatbot, and handles the user input and output.

Future Improvements
Possible future improvements to this program could include:

Adding support for more advanced mathematical operations
Allowing the user to choose which type of mathematical operation to perform
Adding error handling for invalid user inputs
Creating a more natural language processing interface for the chatbot
